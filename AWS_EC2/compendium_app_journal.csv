#a Some things are up to us and some are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions, in short whatever is our doing -Epictetus a#

#a Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well -Epictetus a#

#a Never say about anything 'I have lost it', but instead 'I have given it back' -Epictetus a#

#a What is the price of a head of lettuce, so if someone who has paid an obol takes the head of lettuce, and you who not pay do not take them, do not think taht you are worse off then the one who did. For just as he has the the lettuce, you have the obol that you did not pay. It is the same way in this case. You were not invited to someones banquet, you did not give the host the price of the meal. He sells if for praise; he sells it for attention -Epictetus a#

#o The teaching of Epictetus seem to me to not be about not caring of what happens in the world, or about not wanting to change what happens, but to always accept what happens, and to be unperturbed by anything that happens. 

As Epictetus says ""you would not give your body to any passerby, so why give your judgement?"" - this in essence means, you would not let external events control you physically, why allow them to control you mentally or emotionally.

The confluence of work, study, family and really the first year of my life of feeling really depressed was a trial. 

 From this trial has emerged someone quite different than the year previous. 

My unbridled confidence has been tempered through these experiences, yet what I would say has emerged from this is someone dedicated to self reflection, dedicated to understanding why and what I must to do, and someone resolved in their pursuits - #a The unexamined life is not worth living - Socrates a#

The feelings of depression have been catalysts to be more reflective (meditation) and to seek answers to the struggles of human experience from external sources. 

Specfically this year I've turned to Epictetus, Nietzsche, Marcus Aurelius, Jordan Peterson, Yuval Noah Hararri. Nassim Taleb has remained a constant as always,

There have been a number of recurring themes which I'll now express:

#a People words do not reflect their beliefs, their actions do - Jordan Peterson a#

#a To understand yourself, you must carefully watch your actions - Jordan Peterson a#

#a Wish struggle upon all you know, for that is how they grow -Nietzche a#

#o My philosophical stance at this point is attempting to synthesize the ethical teachings of the Stoics with the Taleb antifragile, the Nietzchen compulsion for stressors to become better

It is my thought is this moment that one must be Stoic in relation to the past, Antifragile towards the future, and Nietzchen towards struggle of life. 

This Nietzchen approach seems to have some parallels with: 

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day; 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on that sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
